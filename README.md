## Overview

![screenshot](/public/sample.png)

This is my first project from devchallenge.io platform and I've been more comfortable than expected.

I focused on match the design as much as possible with not too many details, transitions and so on, but I'd like to improve it in that way someday.

It took me a bit of effort to achieve a full responsive design :)

The demo is fully working but since there is no design to remove the filters I didn't apply any workaround, but any help is welcome!

Also, a detail stay page when clicking in a stay picture it would be the next development.

Feel free to propose corrections and improvements
